# 📊 An Evaluation of Different Methods for Synthetic Data Generation on Real Data Sets

## Julia Höpler – Master's Thesis

This repository contains data, code, and plots for evaluating various synthetic data generation methods on real-world datasets using a comprehensive evaluation framework.

---

## 💻 Computational Environment

All computations were performed on a Microsoft Windows 11 Pro system with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU and 8 GB of RAM.

- **R version**: 4.4.2  
- **Python environment**: Anaconda (conda version 23.7.4)  
  - Jupyter Notebooks and Python-based synthesizers (CTGAN, TVAE, PrivBayes, etc.) were executed using the Anaconda environment.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 📁 Heart Failure Prediction Data

This folder contains several subfolders and files:

- *Raw Data*: Original, raw data.
- `Data.R`: Pre-processing code before synthetic data generation.
- Code for five synthesizers (synthetic data generated by **TABSYN**, provided by Jan Kapar, stored in the subfolder *Data*):
  - ARF: `synthesize_data_with_arf_heart_failure.R`
  - CTGAN: `ctgan_heart_failure.ipynb`
  - PrivBayes: `privbayes_heart_failure.ipynb`
  - Synthpop: `synthesize_data_with_synthpop_heart_failure.R`
  - TVAE: `tvae_heart_failure.ipynb`
- Evaluation scripts:
  - `evaluation_disclosure_risk_heart_failure.R`
  - `evaluation_utility_heart_failure.R`
  - `more_evaluation_criteria_heart_failure.R`
- Evaluation results located in:
  - *evaluation_disclosure_risk*
  - *evaluation_more_criteria*
  - *evaluation_utility*
- `functions.R`: Contains all required utility and disclosure risk evaluation functions.
- `radar_plots_heart_failure.R`: Code for generating radar plots.
- `record_level_similarity_heart_failure.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook comparing IMS function results with those from the `synthcity` package.
